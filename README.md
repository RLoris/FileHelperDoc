# Setup

![Nodes](./assets/node10hd.png)

1. [Get the plugin on the marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/file-helper-bp-library) and install the plugin for the engine version you wish to use
2. Create or open an unreal engine project with a supported version
3. In the editor, go to Edit/Plugins, search for the plugin, check the box to enable it and restart the editor
4. When a new plugin version is available, go to your Epic Games Launcher, under Unreal Engine/Library, below the engine version, you will find your installed plugins, find the plugin and click on update, then wait for it to finish and restart your editor

# Support

### Bugs/Issues

If you encounter issues with this plugin, you **should** report it, to do so, in the editor, go to Edit/Plugins, search for this plugin, click on the plugin support button, this will open your browser and navigate to the plugin issue form where you need to fill in all the relevant details about your issue, this will help me investigate and reproduce it on my own in order to fix it. Be precise and give as many details as you can. Once solved, a new plugin version will be submitted to the marketplace, update the plugin and you are good to go. **Due to epic marketplace limitations, I can only patch/update this plugin for the last 3 engine version, older engine versions will not be supported anymore.**

### Feature requests

If you want a new feature relevant to this plugin use case, you can submit a request in the [plugin marketplace question page](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/file-helper-bp-library/questions). I **may** add this new feature in a future plugin version.
